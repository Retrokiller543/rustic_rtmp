## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the issues tab on github to report any issues or security vulnerabilities. You may also send me an [email](emil.schutt@gmail.com) if its a major vulnerability.

I will respond as fast as i possibly can but it could take some time sometimes if i have alot of other things going on at school.
